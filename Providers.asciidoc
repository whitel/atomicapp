== Providers

This chapter describes how to use and configure the providers included
with Atomic App. It gives you a short overview of all available
providers and how to use them.

Not all Atomic Apps must support each provider: one Atomic App may
only include deployment information for OpenShift3 while another does
support OpenShift3 and Kubernetes.

=== List of providers

Atomic App 0.1.0 includes three providers: 

* Docker, which is the most simple one
* Kubernets
* OpenShift 3

All providers assume that you install and run the Atomic App on a host
that is part of the backend cluster or runs docker directly. By now we
do not support remote deployments.

=== Choosing a provider

While deploying an Atomic App you can choose one of the providers by
setting it in `answers.conf`:

```
[general]
provider: openshift
```

Providers may need additional configuration.

=== Docker Provider

==== features

The Docker provider will simply start a docker container on the host
the Atomic App is deployed.

==== configuration values

There are no configuration values for the Docker provider.


=== Kubernetes Provider

==== features

The Kubernetes Provider supports namespaces, this will deploy an
application into a given namespace. All components of the applications
will be created in that namespace.

=== OpenShift3 Provider

==== features

The OpenShift3 Provider will deploy and run an Atomic App on a
OpenShift instance provided via a OpenShift configuration file.
And OpenShift configuration file is written to disk after you have
logged in, see
http://lists.openshift.redhat.com/openshift-archives/users/2015-March/msg00014.html[osc
login announcement]

You need to provide a copy of `.config/openshift/.config` so that the
provider may use this configuration to deploy and run the Atomic App.

As of 0.1.0 of Atomic App, only
http://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html[OpenShift templates] will be
preprocessed by Atomic App during the run phase: parameters within a
template file will be replaced by the
https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/blob/master/spec/0.0.2/README.md#paramsObject[params]
supplied to Atomic App, names need to match.
